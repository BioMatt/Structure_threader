#Structure_threader helper scripts

This dir contains two scripts that will install structure and faststructre, respectively in a semi automatic way.

Both scripts default the programs' install locations to ~/Software/<program_name>. You can change this in the scripts themselves should you wish to change this location.

##install_structure.sh

This script will download and install structure.

###Requirements:

* a C compiler, such as GCC.

In every HPC this should be available.

In Ubuntu, all you should need is the package "build-essential" (if it is not already installed for some reason). In other distros, the package name should be similar.

##install_faststructure.sh
